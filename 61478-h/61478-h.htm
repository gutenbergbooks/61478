<h2 class="nobreak">PREFACE</h2></div>

<p class="center">&#8220;We wake with wrists and ankles jewelled
still.&#8221;</p>


<p><span class="smcap">There</span> are many ways of entering fairyland;
sometimes there is a door in the
ground, and he who goes through finds
himself in some great hall or carved
and painted chamber. Sometimes we
find the morning dew on a flower
and touch the eyes with it; or, like
John Dietrich, catch the cap which
the fairies are flinging and put it on our
own heads: and immediately the little
people spring into sight, we hear the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
sweetness of their music and see the
glitter of their hidden treasure and
watch the merriness of their games.</p>

<p>The difficulty of the first method is
to find the way, of the second to find
the will; and John Dietrich&#8217;s way is
the venture of confidence.</p>

<p>Children are continually in fairyland;
grubbing in mother earth they
find the door; as they tumble on the
grass the morning dew touches their
eyes and makes them pure.</p>

<p>But sometimes the light of fairyland
will shine suddenly about you; and
you know it is no common glow
though it seems but the light of day
to many. So a child sauntering and
playing at midday in the fields may
throw back its head and look into a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
deep blue summer sky, and be seized
on a sudden by a beauty which troubles
the spirit, a greatness which weighs
upon the soul and wearies it, till the
will fails. Or the light may shine
softer at evening through the nursery
window, when roofs of houses and
branches of elder purple and darken
against a sky all purest primrose, and
draw the young spirit with a half-comprehended
longing. Sometimes it
comes with raptures of sunlight in a
green garden; sometimes cold and
strange in moonlight when existence
holds its breath, and earth is lost in
shadow or refined to vapour in uncertain
light; sometimes with a fullness
of peace in pale emerald of evening
light jewelling the latticed windows<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
of an old house, till the enchantment
thickens and the spirit pants with the
presage of the moment, waiting for
a revelation which still delays.</p>

<p>And sometimes it is filled with the
very spirit of the little people: curious,
amused, fantastic&mdash;as when you walk
on a sea-shore, and suddenly, as with
the touch of a charm, the pool at
your feet becomes a little inland sea:
you see the rocky shores sloping down,
the sandy bottom, the submarine promontories
through the blue: forests of
seaweed sway; a terrible creature with
claws crawls out through pale coralline;
a lump of red jelly stretches out
its arms and becomes now a living,
crimson flower, now a horrid polypus
ravaging, irresistible; a fairy being<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
mailed in translucent armour floats on
with antennæ fiercely waving; and you
are back in fairyland.</p>

<p>Many times you may borrow the
Red Cap to watch the boy Stevenson
titanically carve mountains and seas
in a mere mess of porridge; or to hear
with Charles Kingsley when the grouse
prophesies doom on the moor or the
empty gnat boasts himself beside the
stream. But sweetest of all it is to win
for yourself the charm which opens
your eyes in wood or field, and to hear
with awakened ear the voices of created
things.</p>

<p>These things should be at our command;
but the things which children
know we must re-learn; and there is no
truth more evident to the child nor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
more surely proved to the philosopher
than that all which we see or hear
depends for all its meaning on the soul
of the world that no man sees or hears.
Let this book be taken as a short and
simple lesson-book in hidden meanings.
Life gives us many lessons hard to
read, and problems painful to unriddle;
but here in kind and simple wise our
lesson was made plain and the page
was pleasant to read: for to the eyes
of everyday, in varying scenes, among
diverse races, and nations long since
dead &#8220;the dear old nurse&#8221; showed us
the things which follow. She brought
us through the Gates of Gold and
sent us to float on the serene water
below a pleasant pasture; she taught us
daily, dwelling on the other side; led us<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
by moonlight to the Court of the King;
showed us through sordid circumstance
the silent romance on the golden hill, as
she had showed us romantic incidents,
even in the Desert City; then she surrendered
us to the guardianship of her
child Imagination who, through the
voices of others, brought back for us
the Oriental vision of the royal boat
in the mysterious midnight solemnity.
And from this our older guardian led
us back, and blotting out for us sight
and sound of a populous city by a
transparent veil, made us understand
how to trust the mightiness of the life
of which we were part.</p>

<p>Then she bade us close the book
with the touch of pain and healing
sent to quicken into life, and again<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
Imagination sent us, among the scenes
of daily life to look for the beautiful
kingdom which endures: And we must
say it in what form we may, so that
we catch the meaning of the simple
word, so early and so often said, from
which our stubborn sense rebels, &#8220;the
prison is the world of sight.&#8221;</p>

<p>Thus before memory should fade too
much I wrote down some of the things
I had under guidance witnessed and experienced,
and those which the child
Imagination had, as I say, taught in
divers ways.</p>

<p>For too often we let memory lie like
a rabbit in a winter burrow; and
imagination buzzes on the surface of
things like a fly on a pane: we narrow
our vision to our purpose and our hearing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
to intelligible voices, till it needs
a shock of strangeness or of beauty to
bring us back to realities&mdash;to rouse
memory to throw open the door in the
hillside, to make imagination leave its
sheet of glass for the world of air and
light, to let the beauties and the music
of the infinite creation reach the dull
brain.</p>

THE GATES OF GOLD</h2></div>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> favourite game with Noah&#8217;s Ark
was to make the nursery table an
Island of Delight. The Delight must
have centred in the looking-glasses,
which, with frames discreetly hidden
in moss, mirrored in their unruffled
surfaces forms of numerous ducks and
geese and other less decided species
of birds. Certainly the other furnishings
of the Island were not
particularly delightful, for it was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
thickly populated with wild beasts
of horrid aspect and defective limbs,
and specimens of that strange pinkish
animal of which Noah is so fond,
and which may be classified with
equal probability as a Dingo or a
Wild Boar.</p>

<p>My earliest ideas of an Oasis were
combined of this Island of Delight
and of the description of Elim. The
Oasis would be round as the nursery
table; it would be covered with
lush green grass like a water-meadow.
It would have about seventy palm-trees
standing at fairly regular intervals,
and between the palm-trees there
would be (instead of the looking-glasses)
bubbling springs of water crystal-clear.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>When at last I saw an Oasis it was
unlike my vision&mdash;my Vision of
Delight. There was no grass, but there
were more palm-trees; there were no
crystal fountains, but trickles of brown
water in sandy channels. It came up
to my ideal in one point only&mdash;there
was none of that indefiniteness of outline
which is so repulsive to the simple
mind. Even as you can stand on
the bridge above Mentone, and see
a milestone with France on one side
and a milestone with Italy on the
other, so here you could take your
stand and say &#8220;That on my right
hand is Desert, and that on my left
is Oasis.&#8221;</p>

<p>We had been travelling all day over
the sandy, dusty plains of North<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
Africa; we had found little to eat
at the shed-like stations except blue
cheese and musty bread; and towards
evening we entered a rocky defile. At
the end of this defile they said were
the Gates of Gold. There was not
much to see and the train loitered on.</p>

<p>Suddenly we saw at the end of the
valley two great escarpments of reddish
rock; at their foot leaned one palm-tree,
behind was a glimpse of blue
hills. The evening sunlight fell
golden on the Golden Gates as we
passed through and suddenly cried
out, for everywhere below us spread a
sea of waving palm-trees. This was
the Oasis.</p>

<p>The Oasis lay on a plain so flat
that the horizon to the south curved<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
like the horizon of the sea; and like
little clouds resting on the ocean here
and there an oasis showed greyish
green in the distance. To the north
lay a range of hills, which guarded
the enchanted place from the world
of men. The flatness drew the soul
with a strange attraction, until one
longed to go out over it farther than
eye could reach, anywhere or nowhere.
The desert was in sandy ridges like
a badly ploughed field; isolated tufts
of a heath-like plant grew here and
there; often there lay on the ground,
as if spilled from a cart, yellow apples,
reddening invitingly. Evil fruits these
are, full of dust and bitterness,
and even the camel will not eat
them.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>But within the Oasis were golden
oranges, juicy, like no oranges you
eat here, for they ripen on the dark,
glossy trees; there were gardens of
purple fig and yellow citrons large
as the head of an Arab child; and
the dates were sweet and large, and
half transparent in their candied
clusters.</p>

<p>But the enchanted time was when
the moon was high, its silver light
was faintly tinged with rose; then
one walked under the palm-trees, and
light and shadow lay like silver and ebony
across the path, interlacing and waving
if some faint breeze stirred them, and
the strange, sweet odours of the East
lay warm and thick, and the tinkle
of Arab sounds were in our ears, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
the slim brown figures moved across
the path; and we went back to dream
of silver lights and waving, ebon
shadows.</p>

<p>And one morning we went away
from the Oasis, and passed through
the Gates of Gold, and back into the
world of men, to find we had been
but two days away.</p>

THE LAKE WITHIN THE WORLD</h2></div>


<p><span class="smcap">There</span> were other such enchanted
places in this land, and one could step
aside from the high-road of life into
a place of fantasy and sweet illusion.
The dawdling, leisured train set us
down one day at a wayside station.
No houses were in sight, but behind
a clump of trees a cloud of steam rose
into the air, as if all the world was
a-washing. The train dawdled away<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
across the plain and we went towards
the trees to find ourselves in face of
a shining, misty waterfall. The white
stone was streaked with grey and pink;
the water boiled up in little cauldrons
and fell down in a cloud of steam;
at the bottom of the dazzling rocks
oleanders bent over the warm streams,
maiden-hair fringed the banks; hoary
olives with twisted trunks rose above
the oleanders.</p>

<p>While we still waited there came up
from the side of the steaming river
a splendid figure&mdash;a woman all in
scarlet hung about with silvery chains.
&#8220;That,&#8221; said the guide, &#8220;is the washer-woman.&#8221;
We climbed up behind the
waterfall, where it sprang in its strange
excitement out of the earth, and found<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
a stone courtyard, built round with
little empty houses, one of these
prepared for us.</p>

<p>While we paused at the door a
moment, I saw between the stones a
tiny plant&mdash;a plant to conjure with.
It is like clover, splashed with crimson.
A poet who wore the Red Cap has
said that this crimson is the blood of
Spring, and, to him, a drop of his own
heart&#8217;s blood.</p>

<p>A French family were living here
in a clean, empty house with airy
guest-rooms; and while they regaled
us with wild-boar&#8217;s flesh they talked
of the topics of their day: how the
jackals howled about the courtyard in
winter; how the rugged way to the
Roman City was not yet open; how<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
the locusts came down ten years ago,
swarm upon swarm, till you could hear
the sound of the eating of their hosts
by night; how they devoured fruit and
leaf and bark like the &#8220;army&#8221; in Joel,
and then melted like snow under the
sun.</p>

<p>In this strange, quiet land we slept
well, and went out next day over the
pleasant undulating plain, watered by
warm streams with their bordering of
oleander and fern, and sheltered by
olive and carob.</p>

<p>At last we came to a place where
a grassy bank swept round us in a half
circle. &#8220;Fourteen years ago,&#8221; said the
guide &#8220;the shepherds feeding their
flocks close by heard a great noise, and
running hither saw the earth had fallen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
in,&#8221; and he pointed as he spoke to a
crack in the side of the bank, just such
a rent as a great tree makes when it
falls, tearing its roots out of the
ground. &#8220;Into that,&#8221; he said, &#8220;you
must go.&#8221;</p>

<p>So we went towards it in faith, and
found when we got there a man could
easily pass in. As we descended into
the hot twilight inside the ground a
bat flew out. We went down-hill until
the guide stopped us, where there
seemed to lie at our feet a little blue
dust over the stones, for this was the
still blue water of a lake that stretched
away into deep and deeper darkness.
As we stood we heard out of the darkness
the splash of oars, a light shone
on the water, and round the sheer wall<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
of rock on the right came a boat with
a lantern at its prow.</p>

<p>Into this we stepped, and it moved
on into the deep shadows. Out of the
dark water rose great stalagmites like
columns, and stalactites dropped to meet
them like heavy pendants from some
vaulted roof. We moved round rocky
chambers where the lantern shone on
the walls, and through halls whose
boundaries were unrevealed; all sense
of direction and of time was lost till
a flash of lightning seemed to fall on
the water. It was only the reflected
light of a grey day, filtered through
the rent in the earth down which we
had come, but after that great darkness
it seemed dazzling.</p>

<p>So we went up again to the light<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
of day, and back through that pleasant
land. But when we came away, I
brought with me a leaf of the crimson-splashed
clover &#8220;to witness if I lie.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">In</span> the desert not twenty miles from
Cairo there has sprung up the mushroom
growth of a wonder-working
Health Resort. It possesses several
hotels, an &#8220;Establishment,&#8221; a golf
links, and everything which a really<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
desirable Health Resort must possess.<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>
But at the time when I first knew that
tract of sand on which it stands the
case was far otherwise. If one must
have summarized the attractions of the
place they would have run:&mdash;</p>


<table border="0" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="2" summary="table">

<tr><td>Fifteen pyramids</td><td>                Distant</td></tr>
<tr><td>One palm-tree</td><td>                   Distant</td></tr>
<tr><td>Several ill-smelling streams</td><td>    Quite close</td></tr>
<tr><td>Flat sandy desert</td><td>               Near and distant</td></tr>


<tr><td colspan="2" align="center">A perfectly bare range of low hills beginning half<br />
a mile away and reaching to Arabia.</td></tr>
</table>

<p>An English advertisement of foreign
appearance bore witness to these
charms and ended with a striking
appeal to leave for desert air &#8220;the
filthy, stinking city,&#8221; as it characterized
Grand Cairo.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>We responded to the appeal, and
went to stay in a hotel of large
corridors and wide balconies which
looked out upon the fifteen pyramids.
Opposite was a small, bare house called
Villa Mon Bijou. The town was
planted on a desert so flat that it
seemed a German toy town set upon a
table; only there were no trees with
curly green foliage to be seen, because
no one might plant a living thing unless
by order from Government.<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> Neat little
pavements with new little gas lamps
traversed it rectangularly, and came
every way to an abrupt stop in heavy
desert sand. There was a tiny English
church, in which the few English<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
Christians staying in the place assembled.
Little flat-roofed villas like
coloured cardboard boxes stood back
from the pavement with strange ornaments
above the gate; here a stone
eagle with knees turned outwards,
there a stuffed fox. Backwards and
forwards we went under noontide sun
to the baths, and were told to rest
in the Khedive&#8217;s sitting-room, upholstered
with yellow satin.</p>

<p>One would have thought that
nothing so brand-new could have been
found in sight of the pyramid of Unas
and the cemetery of Sakkara. Even
death seemed glaringly recent. One
day we drove in the desert and searched
the horizon for objects of interest.
&#8220;What is that?&#8221; we said, pointing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
to a small building on the outskirts of
the town. &#8220;That,&#8221; replied Saïd with
pride, &#8220;is the new slaughter-house.&#8221;
&#8220;And this enclosure?&#8221; &#8220;The English
cemetery.&#8221; &#8220;And that yonder?&#8221;
&#8220;The Italian mortuary.&#8221; &#8220;What is
that which looks like a village on the
hill?&#8221; &#8220;That is the Mahommedan
burying-place.&#8221; &#8220;And that beyond?&#8221;
&#8220;Another graveyard.&#8221; Then he drove
us through a valley of Hinnom, where
we marked, among other things, a
dead camel and a dead calf; and as we
passed between the windmill and the
ill-smelling stream we saw three coffins
lie, brand-new, unguarded and alone.</p>

<p>But towards evening a certain magic
fell upon the place. We had gone one
day towards the single palm-tree in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
desert. Miles and miles of sand and
air, unstirred by any slightest sound,
seemed to lie between us and that
solitary tree, and when we reached it
nothing could be seen but the slot of
beasts around it.</p>

<p>Then as we turned the light began
to change. Behind the fifteen pyramids
the sky glowed scarlet till it
tinged the water of the Nile with
blood. Far up in the blue hung an
ethereal arc of crimson light; the
heaven deepened to indigo where it
met night; kindled into indescribable
sapphire where it touched the dying
day; the conflagration grew till at last
earth glowed its answer to the sky
with a purple flood rising and deluging
sand-hills and valley.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>As we neared the toy town with its
twinkling lights the glow had died
away, and there gloomed before us
dimly a knoll round which knelt the
camels of the Bedawîn; the figures
which moved beside them with dark,
fine profile and the white cloths round
their heads seemed like Magi come to
greet the Royal Child.</p>

<p>Again we went up the hills which,
like a low rampart, bordered the plain
to the east. At the foot they were
carved into quarries of a stone so white
that it seemed like wedges cut in a
great cream cheese. The hills were
barren, but for a few straggling plants
and grasses about; like a raised map or
the skeleton of the world. Yet as we
went on we still found always in front,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
like the marks on the carriage drive,
a curving, trodden road, winding up
vanishing out of sight.</p>

<p>While we stood looking at the loneliness
there came daintily stepping,
with embroidered shoes and black
silk mantles round them, a party of
women to meet us; in front a man
carried a child. I cannot but think
that they vanished into thin air when
they had passed us.</p>

<p>Or again one might descend towards
the river, on the road between the
fields. There as the sky lights its fires
towards evening the men would leave
their work and stand with dripping
feet on their coarse outer garment by
the water&#8217;s edge to say the evening
prayer. Near the town stood a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
sycamore, under which, on a raised
platform, some men prayed loud and
lustily five times a day. &#8220;God likit
them very much,&#8221; said the donkey-boy;
but with cynical estimation of the
importance of this fact he added, &#8220;If
I bray, where is my business?&#8221;</p>

<p>A brougham on the road as we
returned: Europe is at one side. But
within sat a woman golden haired,
with her veil pushed back and a cigarette
between her teeth. That one
passing, demure and dignified, with an
attendant wrinkled and stately, is a
Princess walking for her health. Here
two in a victoria, with transparent veils
and Paris bonnets, show Turkish
emancipation; and the shut and blinded
brougham with a Sudanese on the box
gives sign of Arab propriety.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>And now as the town is reached we
begin to see the meaning of this modern
city; those high walls are not merely
meant to hide a garden of flowers, nor
does the lattice serve only to keep the
sunlight from fading Eastern fabrics.
But behind the pierced work of that
window peers some Scheherazade at
her story-weaving, wondering what
life means, &#8220;half sick of shadows.&#8221;
There is the Pasha&#8217;s house, and the
whisper goes that these are slaves.</p>

<p>A strange, pathetic figure trod this
road daily, a man of aquiline face,
brown skin, and pointed beard, dressed
in a fine embroidered garment of
scarlet with white cloth falling on his
shoulders.</p>

<p>Evening by evening he left the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
town, and squatting by one of the
sulphur streams looked out with level
eyes towards the farthest horizon of the
south, his beads held idly in his hands.
That man, we learned, was the Pasha&#8217;s
gatekeeper and came from the Sudan.</p>

<p>One day a crowd ran and digged
by the side of this stream. &#8220;What
are they doing?&#8221; we asked, and the
answer was that they were making a
garden. It will surely blossom like
the rose&mdash;but not on those flowers
will the gatekeeper gaze.</p>

<p>In the evening when the moon has
risen, and a great star close to her tip
hangs the banner of the Moslems in
heaven, the magic is most potent.
Then the flat-roofed houses become
palaces of marble, and among the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
dark figures stealing through the
street you look for Mesrour on his
secret errands, that he may show you
the mysteries of life and death behind
veil and wall and lattice. Then one
may well believe that over at Sakkara
under the sand-hills the dead are
sitting in their carven chambers, to
play their games and cast their spells
and eat and drink.</p>

<p>And yet in Europe they talk of freeing
Egypt, and speak of the &#8220;patriot&#8221;
dervish; and at Gordon&#8217;s death-place,
where the gatekeeper was born and
from which he was stolen, they entertain
the Pasha with the honours of a
burgess.</p>

<p>Who wakes? who dreams? Surely
the Western eye sees clear, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
looks on the place in the searching
noonday light; for it is the hand of
the Western that planted Villa Mon
Bijou and raised the gas lamps.</p>

<p>Leave it then with its neat realities
and its fancied magic; draw away
over the sand towards the Great River
and the dwellings of the dead; and as
one might see across the great ocean
a line of reef built up by tiny busy
insects, so look back once to see over
&#8220;immeasurable sand,&#8221; &#8220;the city sparkle
like a grain of salt.&#8221;</p>

THE OTHER SIDE</h2></div>


<p><span class="smcap">When</span> Alice went through the
Looking-glass, she sprang down into a
world where a change had passed on
all familiar things; so that she must
walk away from the things she wanted
to arrive at, and time ran backwards
and stopped. When a merman
brought a girl through the translucent
mirror of the water to be his wife in
the great caves below the sea, she heard
but dimly the church bell and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
sounds of the world above, and saw but
seldom its sights when she rose through
the bay. And when Tom slipped into
the stream he found himself in a great
empty world below the water; and it
was not for some time that he was able
even to see the crowds of merry water-babies
with which it was peopled.</p>

<p>We had often looked into the looking-glass
from a little village on the
bank of a great river. Sometimes this
river was only a river of muddy water;
sometimes towards evening, when no
wind ruffled its surface, it was a mirror
of burnished metal, reflecting the fires
of the west; sometimes a river of
molten gold. Sometimes, when the sky
was bright above, it was a stretch of
sapphire, edged with gold and set in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
emerald, for beyond the sandy shore of
the river lay a great sea of green
corn&mdash;few trees were there, but the
waving corn, and animals pasturing
in luxuriant vetch; and beyond this
again began the sandy desert, which
stretched away to the bases of the hills.</p>

<p>So the River ran, dividing the
country, and the two sides of it have
been called since the beginning of
history <i>the two lands</i>. The River was
broad, and so deep that the reptiles of
the one side have never been able to
cross to the other, and the lizards of
the two lands are of quite different
kinds.</p>

<p>But just at the edge of the desert
you begin to see traces of quite a different
kind of life, the giant images of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
people long dead, and their temples;
behind in the cliff you may see, even
from across the river, the doors of rock-hewn
chambers which are called the
Eternal Habitations. That side of the
river is called the City of the Dead.</p>

<p>Now the people of the village opposite
used to speak of going over to the
&#8220;Other Side.&#8221; They crossed the river,
and rode through the fields of waving
corn, and the men and women who
moved among the fields, who tethered
the beasts to pasture, the little children
who drove oxen in the creaking <i>sakhieh</i>
seemed like figures of a picture to
them; and when they reached the City
of the Dead, the desert places of the
Eternal Habitations, the Silent Citizens
were unperceived by them, their voices<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
were unheard; or they seemed to see
but rude stone figures of an earlier age,
dead bodies, unskilful paintings on the
wall. Before they could recognize the
living men they had turned back and
recrossed the river, and never knew
that they had been so near the mysteries
of the &#8220;Other Side.&#8221;</p>

<p>But when you came to live in the
country on the Other Side the aspect of
it was altogether different. At the
back, the country was walled in by
precipices of rock, a great golden wall
from which spurs ran down on to the
desert. If you climbed up the first
ridge to get a farther view you saw
ridge on ridge of the same barren hills,
with golden rocky defiles, reflecting back
and back again the eastern sunlight. At<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
certain hours of the day a stream of
people, like small ants, poured up one
valley, over a hill and back again across
the river; otherwise there was never a
sign of human life, except that, from
peak to peak, at far distances, you might
see a little rock-built shelter, and the
solitary figure of a watchman who
guarded the chambers of the dead.</p>

<p>Between the hills and the cultivated
lands are lower hills, half rock, half
sand, with sandy slopes. In the sand
there gaped holes about the paths as
you rode or walked, and looking down
you might peer into a chamber,
sculptured with images of men and
women sitting at feasts; or higher up
in the hill you would see a squared doorway
of stone facing sometimes a great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
courtyard, and entering, you might find
a pillared chamber, gold vessels and
jewelled boats painted on the wall;
here a picture of a man propelling his
bark through marshy groves populous
with birds, there one driving the
plough, and a woman sowing corn;
here a kingly child on his nurse&#8217;s knee;
there the antelope caught by the dogs
and dripping blood from the hunter&#8217;s
arrow. The longer one lived here the
more one began to see of these doors in
the hillside and holes in the ground,
until it seemed that the whole mountain
was honeycombed with the rock-hewn
chambers. Sometimes you might
cross a courtyard where the eastern
slope of a hill lay in cool shadow;
pass through one painted room after<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
another, chapel and shrine, shrine and
chapel, and so come out on the other
side of the hill still golden in the light
of the setting sun.<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

<p>Down below these rocks, clustering
round the doorways of the lowest slopes,
are brown houses that a day&#8217;s rain can
bring to ruin, villages like a child&#8217;s
building in sand; open yards, sheds
thatched with straw, erections in mud
like gigantic mushrooms with upturned
brim; and for the more permanent
part of the habitation these childish
builders have borrowed the rocky
chambers.</p>

<p>For the truth is that two races of
people inhabit this country. The one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
race are like merry, selfish children,
though a mystery of simplicity hangs
about them like the mystery of the
hidden life of a child. In their villages
ring sounds of men and animals all
day and all night; voices are hoarse
with talking and singing; it seems
like a great orchestra of the inhabitants.
Up to the middle of the night donkeys
chant their canon, cocks blow their
clarion; all day you hear the groaning
of camels, the agitated voices of kids and
lambs, the lamentable cries of their
mothers; towards evening the lowing
of kine as they return from the <i>sakhieh</i>,
the fury of the dogs, the provocative
cry of the jackal, and sometimes as
night falls the long, weird howling of
the wolf. Then when the moon is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
full the children sing in chorus, apeing
the elder boys at their work; the
workers of the day are the feasters of
the night, and drum and song help
on the fantasia. Here is merriment
and noise, complaint, vociferous demand,
swift anger, cheerfulness again;
the ragged children and young animals
race and play from simple excess of
vitality.</p>

<p>Yet all this noise is like the chattering
of a brook in a quiet place, though
it beats loud upon the ear it is as
powerless against the great quiet of
the desert as lapping waves against a
rocky shore.</p>

<p>For the other race that lives here
is silent, yet their words have gone
out into the ends of the world. You<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
leave the villages and mount the hill,
and the noise comes fainter from below.
You pass through the chambers and
see these greater people live their lives
and learn from the writing on the wall
what &#8220;he saith.&#8221; You go towards
evening up some valley of golden rocks,
where the sunlight reflected from the
sand shines on the shadowed cliff like
the shining of a hidden lake, and find
in a fold of the hill a little empty
temple of old time; or descending
rocky steps pass into a chamber where
the walls present great deeds of state,
ambassadors clad in fine embroidered
dresses bring foreign tribute of nations
long perished, precious things of gold
and gem, strange beasts from far
countries. Or when clouds are chasing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
through a moonlit sky you pass up
a road between sand-hills towards a
temple of these silent races; its white
pillars and colonnades now flash out
silver in a sudden gleam of light; and
now the shadow of a cloud passing
with purple bloom over the hill above
annihilates courts and terraces, until it
seems a magician&#8217;s wand is at work,
destroying and re-creating this ghostly
building.</p>

<p>Or at evening you ride through the
place of tombs; the sun has sunk,
and a glow, orange and red, gives a
sharp outline to the hills. Out of
the holes in the ground come an army
of little shadows, sweeping faster than
the eye can follow them over the
unlevel ground; and from the rocks<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
on the left peers out a sharp nose and
ears, and the jackal runs with heavy
drooping tail across the path, and
dodges behind a big stone to peer out
with insatiable curiosity as you pass;
or in the night one hears the cry of
a wild cat caught and torn by the dogs.</p>

<p>There are no merry flocks of birds
here as in the cultivated land below, and
but little sound of their voices. The
sparrow indeed, who holds nothing
sacred, chatters his minute affairs in
the great silence; the discreet wagtail
runs about the ledges of the rocks,
the black and white chat bows on a
stone. But the most part are seen on
the wing; the soft grey martin, with
its atmosphere of domestic peace,
hovers about the Eternal Habitations,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
thinking to rear its young in the
chambers of the dead; the swallows
made wild by their long flight, and
loosed from the restraints of the North,
build their nests on the cliff, and sweep
at sunset, with musical screams, up and
down the face of the rock; great kites
circle above in the hot noonday, let fall
sometimes their weird whistling cry,
circling on and on till the vast blue
engulfs them; and once, high in the
sky towards evening, there came a flight
of cranes, who wheeled, split, and recrossed,
then gathered decision and
moved stately in black and white
northwards.</p>

<p>All luxuriance of life had vanished.
Even as time seemed to have stood
still, and the people learnt their arts<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
and crafts from those who died six
thousand years ago, so growth seemed
to have vanished from the visible
world. Now and then as you wandered
up a valley a single blade of barley
shone like a gem half hidden by a
stone; or some plant, desert-coloured,
spread, dry greyish tufts, where the
ground retained invisible moisture.
But life hung suspended, and the
longer you dwelt in the country the
more you perceived that you were
living in the City of the Dead.
Sometimes one forgot how days and
weeks were passing, and again a
thousand years were but as yesterday,
a watch in the night. The noises of
the outside world came but faintly:
once, we heard the sound of a nation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
weeping and the nations of the earth
sorrowing with it, and again the sober
welcome to one who came to take upon
him the burden of the State.</p>

<p>So they sorrowed four thousand years
ago&mdash;not without hope. &#8220;A hawk
has soared&mdash;the follower of the god
met his maker.&#8221; So the officers of
State welcomed the son who should
take its cares upon him. And on
that very night when with grief and
praise the nation laid to rest a Queen
and mother in the fullness of her age,
our eyes looked on, resting untouched,
deep in the recesses of the rock, among
the mystic symbols of his faith, the
body of a king swathed still and garlanded
who died three thousand years
before that Queen was born.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>The sounds of war came dimly,
for the pictures of far earlier wars
might meet the eyes day by day;
and when we came on the bodies of
those men who warred and taught
and lived and enjoyed, alert in the
chase, quiescent in the cool breath of
their gardens, they lay quiet with
their ornaments perhaps upon them,
a garland round their neck, a book
between their feet.</p>

<p>But when at last returning we came
down to the fields, we saw that time
indeed had passed. The corn which
was but sprouting when we came, was
full in the ear, and the barley was
yellowing to harvest; the bean-flower
had opened, spread its fragrance and
passed; the purple vetch still lingered;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
the poppy raised an imperial head.
Clouds of gay, thieving sparrows rose
as we passed; the crested lark ran before
us, sprang and hovered with a few notes
of liquid song; tiny birds hung on the
barley blades; the whistle of the quail
came from the deep green where it hid.
The river spread before us like a highway
paved with sapphire; so we passed
along it to the north and the voices
of the world we belonged to rung out
clearer as we moved; and behind us
there faded like a dream that world
whose present is four thousand years of
time with the insistence of its silent
voices, the permanence of the dead, the
fleeting brightness of the living.</p>

THE SILENT ROMANCE</h2></div>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> cock has been defying Achmet
Bukdadi again to-day.</p>

<p>It is a very little cock, hardly larger
than a bantam; its plumage betokens
a fine disregard of race; if you were
pressed you might suggest a remote
relationship to a game-cock. The
cries of Achmet Bukdadi drew me to
the window to see the cock, feathers
raised, parading angrily and scornfully
in front of him. Achmet&#8217;s cries<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
attracted two or three other children,
and they ran about on our terrace
trying to hustle the cock off the edge
of it. Finally one courageous boy
lifted him by the wings, and put him
on the back of another, whence he
descended with feathers and dignity
ruffled to the ground, while the
children dispersed shrieking and
laughing.</p>

<p>Achmet had a more prompt ally
two days ago, when the cock was
doing sentry-go before their front yard
gate and would not let Achmet go
home. His cries called his mother
to his aid, and she came evidently
prepared for the crisis, for she straightway
threw the wand which was in
her hand with unerring aim, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
cock fled vanquished down the village
rubbish-heap.</p>

<p>Achmet&#8217;s mother is the most silent
and most graceful woman in the
village. She is the youngest of Bukdadi&#8217;s
two wives; the other must
be the mother of the sullen looking
boy who lounges after our water-donkey
up and down the hill, for
she is grey haired, while Achmet&#8217;s
mother has thick black plaits under
her blue head veil. She is not
indifferent to matters of dress, for her
outer wrapping is edged with crimson.
She seems far more active than the
other woman, and all her movements,
in the most menial occupation, show
an unconscious grace which tempts
one to the full use of unusual advantages<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
of observation. Her grace is
not the tender quality often so-called,
but a robust deftness and certainty of
action. She had to drive a lame
donkey to the water the other day,
and in the strokes of her staff there
was no more pity for the little beast,
halting and hurrying between two
diverse pains, than for her own
burdened womanhood. The donkey
must drink; she herself would bring
water for the household in the great
earthenware pot balanced on her head.
Hesitation for the animal was as much
out of the question as help for her
from the stepson who lounged past
her with his stick held behind his
shoulders.</p>

<p>So she urged the animal to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
pool beneath the tamarisks, and I
doubt not mounted the hill again with
all the speed that nature would allow.</p>

<p>It is well, perhaps, that she is
taciturn in a yard so populous&mdash;the
other wife, the two sons, Bukdadi
himself, seldom seen, a girl, daughter
or slave, and the little Achmet, not
to speak of the animals&mdash;the white
camel in the corner nearest the gate,
the neat black water-donkey next
him, for the invalid one occupies
the innermost corner, the bullocks
who move with deference at her
bidding, besides Achmet&#8217;s enemy the
cock with his harîm, and the pigeons.
I cannot be sure that the brown sheep
belong to this yard; they are always
being driven out, it is true, but whenever<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
they are not being driven out
they are going in; and it appeared
that the black goat with two kids
was preparing to spend the night in
the hollow stem of the mud fungus,
on the family platform. What makes
conclusions less certain, however, is
that the grey kid now dances up and
down hill with the boy in the yellow-striped
dress, and that the sheep have
more than once called on us in our
dining-room.</p>

<p>Among all these Achmet&#8217;s mother
moves, sober, taciturn, efficient. One
wonders when the transition comes
from the laughing children to the
serious, burdened woman. Marriage
is not the turning-point, for little
Saïda, with her round face and dark<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
eyes and blue-patterned little chin, is
married, though she still prefers to
live with her father and be an occasional
visitor at her husband&#8217;s house.
And what there is of demureness in
Saïda compared to the ragged Ahm
Ibrahim in wild neglected gaiety is
produced evidently not by her marriage
but by her blue dress and her red
dress, her necklace and her earrings.</p>

<p>The burden of the household, but
above all the care of the children, must
work the change, and the trace of
tenderness that there is about Achmet&#8217;s
mother seems all for Achmet. She
exercises no repressive influence on
him, for Achmet, with his grubby
black dress, his thin, merry, ugly little
face with even rows of little white<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
teeth as he lisps his greeting&mdash;Achmet,
whether cantering about on a dhurra
stalk, or pretending to be a man
carrying stones with his grandfather,
or climbing over his neighbours&#8217; walls,
is always gay.</p>

<p>He takes the unexpected gift without
that deliberate anticipation of
favours to come which is the first
acquirement of the Arab baby; and
in his pleasures and his woes alike
Achmet flies to his mother, conveys
to her his bakshîsh of sugar-cane;
wails to her when the cock is warlike
and threatening.</p>

<p>She had him with her one evening
in the great mud chalice which
forms larder, barn, and summer
chamber of the Arab house.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>The sun had gone down, but a
certain unreal glow lay on the hill
behind the village; night was purpling
the sky; her figure rose out of the
shadowy cup powerful and graceful,
with the child crouched at her feet;
the work of the day was over, her
heart&#8217;s desire was with her.</p>

<p>To-day she could not come to the
child when he called, for but two
nights ago there was a movement
and whispering at midnight in the
yard of Bukdadi, and the wail arose
of a voice smaller and younger than
that of little Achmet. So the mother
rests.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">The Approach</span></h3>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> moon had risen as we rode
down the steep, sandy road and
threaded our way through the little
mud enclosures, where dogs, alive for
the excitement of the night, were
prowling on the walls, listening with
ears pricked up for warnings of
enemies, looking with vigilant eyes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
for some alien to draw near. As
we crossed into that part of the village
where they did not know us, a hoarse
storm of barking filled the air, but
in a minute or two we had passed
beyond this, and were out among the
sand-hills between the tombs, where
the whole plain was flooded with a
misty, uncertain light.</p>

<p>Song and merry-making had begun
in the villages, for the full moon is
festival for those who have no artificial
light; but the thud of the drums, the
sound of children&#8217;s voices, and the
barking of dogs faded and died away,
and we came out into a great emptiness,
threading a narrow path between the
tumbled heaps; on each side the
tombs gaped dimly at our feet. On<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
the right hand we looked far away
over desert and field to the great dark
pylons of a temple across the river: on
the left rose sharply the sandy spur
of the hill we were rounding. No
one was in sight and on no side could
we see any human habitation.</p>

<p>We turned round the spur of the
hill into a boulder-strewn valley, arid
and silent. Even at midday there
is little sign of life here, except on
certain days when a stream of people
traverse it and return; otherwise you
find but a chance sown seed, dropped
in a favourable spot; a withering
leaf let fall by some traveller, a stray
pigeon, an &#8220;evil bird&#8221; the Arabs
think, who has left the abode of men
and foresworn its final service for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
their use, to live its hermit life in
the wilderness. Otherwise you see
but the golden limestone rocks,
radiating back the golden Egyptian
sunshine. Then all is bare and keeps
no secret, for the very shadows are
broken by reflected light.</p>

<p>But now the colour of the limestone
showed but faintly in the white
light, and the shadows fell dark from
boulder and rocks. The valley was
empty of life, penetrated with mystery.</p>

<p>There, as we turned, at an angle of
the path was a figure, solitary in the
moonlight, a man in a long, dark
garment, holding by him his donkey
with a sheepskin over its saddle. He
stood waiting here to give us a
message, and having delivered it went<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
back by the way we had come. And
now looking back we could see
nothing of mud village or vast old
temple, no living man of the present,
no stone memorial of the past; we
were alone in a world half lit, wholly
empty, stone and sand as far as eye
could see, with an empty sky above
where the moon had quenched all lesser
lights.</p>

<p>The valley, which we began to see
more clearly, was narrow and rose
steeply on each side; the ground
beneath our feet looked like a river-bed,
on each side of which were large
boulders casting deep black shadows.
From time to time the rocks which
walled the valley so crossed one another
that it seemed the way was barred<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
in front of us, until, as we neared it, we
found the road swept round a corner of
rock. Turning such a corner, again
we found three people silently awaiting
us, two of them the companions who
had preceded us; the third a slim
figure all in white, on foot with
a staff in his hand. He was a man
of some authority over the guard, who,
as we learned later, had lain seven
years in jail for a murder. He ran
with noiseless steps in front of us, and
so heralded we went on to where
the valley broadened out a little,
branching to the right; and at the
entrance a great rock jutting out of
the cliff seemed in the moonlight to
take a fantastic likeness to some
colossal statue of a king, carved, you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
would have said, by an Egyptian of
old.</p>

<p>Our path led us to the left, and here
the cliffs began to close in on us, until
they rose like a wall on each side of a
narrow way, at once so steep and so
rugged that we could not tell whether
the defile was natural or the work of
man. It led at last to where a wall
of rock, barring the way, had been
rudely cut through. In this rough
gateway we halted&mdash;behind us the
rocky passage through which we had
come; before us, as far as we could
see, the hills ran down, like a great
amphitheatre, to a floor of tumbled
sand-heaps.</p>

<p>Here, as we halted, one of our
companions blew a whistle, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
next moment the hills re-echoed to
the sound of a gun. After a moment&#8217;s
pause he blew again, and now dark-draped
figures suddenly appeared
among the desolate rocks, running
noiselessly towards us. After a
moment all but two or three dispersed
again, and we rode forward with the
white, slim figure still in front and
two men in flowing dark garments
following us behind.</p>

<p>The great emptiness, the silence,
the white, uncertain light by which
the rocks showed faintly tinged with
the rose and golden colour of the
limestone, the dark figures suddenly
appearing, noiselessly moving, dispersing
into the night; the strange,
desolate valley winding through all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
apparent barriers into the heart of
the hills seemed like a dream. Surprise
vanished; even observation was
dulled.</p>

<p>So we went forward to the head of
the valley, ringed about with sheer
mountain walls, and perceived that
here the mounds which lay about
the way gaped with open mouths, and
we could see the moonlight shining
through grated doors on the painted
walls of galleries that ran down deep
into the hill.</p>

<p>These we passed, and dismounting
from our beasts, climbed a little
mound, turned behind a projecting
buttress of rock, and found ourselves
opposite to a door cut in the cliff.
One of the men who had followed us<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
went in and left us for a while sitting
without in the moonlight.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">The Presence</span></h3>

<p>The great square doorway of the
tomb showed inky black on the face
of the cliff, golden in the moonlight;
the shaft plunged steeply downwards
into the rock, with short, high steps
roughly cut against one wall. Down
these we slowly made our way, the
utter darkness pricked here and there
by the flame of a candle in some one&#8217;s
hand. A flame shone for a moment on
the little shelf cut back into the rock,
where the string bed and wooden pillow
of the guard still wait his return, just
where he went out and left them so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
many thousand years ago. The steps
stopped suddenly on the edge of a pit
deep and broad; by the light of a
candle held high we could dimly see
the red and blue patterns painted on
its plastered walls. A hole had been
broken through them on the opposite
side of the chasm, and crossing by a
little plank bridge we crept through,
still deeper into the heart of the cliff.
On the other side of the wall the
tunnel still went downwards, but the
faint light showed a deep alcove to
the right. On the rocky floor lay a
man, bound upon a crumbling wooden
boat; the painful bonds still held the
brown and shrivelled limbs, his knees
drawn up, his head pressed back.</p>

<p>Again down the steep stairway we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
climbed, feeling along the rough-cut
wall, and again at the bottom a
chamber opened to the right. A
man, a woman, and a girl lie here,
side by side in the middle of the
floor. They have suffered the indignity
of stripping; wounds are in their
breasts; the thick black hair upon
their heads makes the small faces
and limbs seem the more withered
and unhuman. It is a pitiful sight.</p>

<p>For the third time the rock-hewn
ladder led us down to the square-cut
doorway which opened to the
presence-chamber of a king of
Egypt. The great hall stretched back
into the darkness, dimly lighted by
hidden candles, heavy with the silence
of three thousand years. The faint<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
gleam fell upon the painted walls and
pillars of the eternal dwelling-place,
the work of such far-off hands clear
and fresh with the freshness of
yesterday. On the great square pillars
Amenhetep still feels the fullness of
his earthly life and draws strength
from mysterious communing with the
life-giving god. On the walls a huge
papyrus seems unrolled where the
spirit of the King, in the depth of
the nether world, may learn to wrestle
with and overthrow the serpent-monsters
brought by each gloomy
Hour. At the back of the hall two
steps lead down to the high vaulted
space where stands the great rose-granite
sarcophagus. In the darkness
and the silence the lid or the inner<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
coffin was raised and we were in the
presence of the King.</p>

<p>The dim-veiled figure lay before us,
wrapt in an inexpressible mystery, the
impress of his kingship still upon him,
crowned with the greater dignity of
death. Far from the loved Egyptian
sunshine, from the sweet breath of
the north wind, from the fleeting
ways of men, the inhabitant of the
rock holds his solemn court through
the centuries which have no power
upon him, with the records of his life
and warfare around him and the
mimosa wreaths upon his breast.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>[Since the above was written plunderers penetrated
into the tomb in the absence of the guard,
and the body of Amenhetep II. no longer rests in
his Eternal Habitation.]</p></blockquote>

THE GOLDEN DAHABEAH</h2></div>


<h3>I</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Mahmoud</span> was crouched on the hot
sand, in the shade of a great granite
figure of an old Egyptian king. On
the temple wall at his right hand was
incised the figure of a large hawk,
which had a certain life-like stare and
stride. Below lay the thick green
lake; a little pied kingfisher fluttered
and poised over it. Mahmoud&#8217;s donkey
had strayed a little from his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
owner, and was pulling at some few
blades of thin, straggling weed. The
Father of the Box, who had ridden
him out to Karnak, had some foolish
prejudice against tying up donkeys&#8217;
heads. Mahmoud explained that it
prevented the donkey from having a
headache; but Englishmen always want
things done in their own way.</p>

<p>Yet as Mahmoud sat dreaming, his
eyes fixed on the water, he was thinking
of none of these things. Rather he
was dreaming of little Fatma, Fatma
whom he had run and played with as
a little girl&mdash;but now she was old
enough to be married. He had seen
Fatma as they came out; she was
carrying a waterpot on her head, and
the slender fingers were tipped with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
henna; her hair was plaited over her
brow, and the large blue-studded rings
in her ears swayed as she ran. She
held her veil firmly in her small, white
teeth, and only gave him one look,
half shy, half merry, as she passed.</p>

<p>Mahmoud&#8217;s father and mother said
he must be married this year. He
wished to marry no one but little
Fatma; but ah! the marriage-gift.</p>

<p>He stared at the smooth, thick
water, and droned a little song&mdash;&#8220;Oh,
great holy gardener, let me into the
garden.&#8221;</p>

<p>The sun was just going down, and
as Mahmoud turned idly, half lost in
his dreaming, the rays struck the wall
where was the image of the hawk,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
and the boy stood breathless, for the
hawk was all of gold, and as he
looked the fierce head turned a little.</p>

<p>Through his maze came the voice of
the Father of the Box, crying to him
to get the donkey.</p>

<p>A moment he started and turned,
but when he looked again there was
nothing but the stone hawk carved on
the wall; and again came the call, as
the Englishman and the &#8220;box&#8221; came
round the corner.</p>

<p>Mahmoud gasped and panted: &#8220;The
chicken is all gold.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, the Golden Horus,&#8221; said the
Father of the Box, giving the precious
camera into Mahmoud&#8217;s hand. &#8220;Hurry
up and fetch the donkey, it is getting
dark and damp.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>But he did not ask how a donkey-boy
should know the Golden Horus.</p>


<h3>II</h3>

<p>The donkey-boys were sitting outside
the garden gate of the hotel. Mahmoud
was against the wall, and taking
little part in the flow of conversation.</p>

<p>&#8220;Achmet Effendi will make a big
feast to-morrow,&#8221; said one. &#8220;He has
killed two sheep for his feast.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Achmet Effendi is a very rich
man,&#8221; said Maouad. &#8220;Twenty years
ago he sent his servant Gameel Gameel
to dig up stones to burn and lay on his
field, there where the English &#8216;<i>sidi
matre</i>&#8217; (cemetery) is. But Gameel<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
Gameel found a big pot of golden coins
and he brought them all back to
Achmet Effendi. For ten years they
kept them hidden, then Achmet Effendi
sold them for much money and became
a rich man. That is why he loves
Gameel Gameel better than his son.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Gameel Gameel was a great fool,&#8221;
said Hassan flippantly. &#8220;Why should
he not become a rich man himself?&#8221;</p>

<p>Kuku was speaking aside to Gorgius.</p>

<p>&#8220;I tell my lady that I am going to
be married to Fatma. I say to her:
&#8216;I see Fatma in the market; I like her
very much and she likes me very much.
My mother has arranged it for me. If
you give me an English handkerchief,&#8217;
I say to my lady, &#8216;you shall come to
my wedding.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>&#8220;Liar-boy!&#8221; said Gorgius scornfully;
but Mahmoud feared and sighed in
himself.</p>

<p>A small figure passed, and the
light from the gas lamp showed a
withered old man with a white beard
and smiling face. He wore a red
tarbûsh turbaned about with white,
and trailed a green Mecca robe.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mohammed Mohassib will have a
big feast,&#8221; said one. &#8220;He has killed a
camel and made soup with it. The
Father of the Beard said to Mohammed,
&#8216;You will feed three hundred men to-morrow.&#8217;
Mohammed said, &#8216;I hope
more than that.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Mohammed Mohassib slept in the
temple of Mut,&#8221; said Maouad; &#8220;that
was fifty years ago, when he was a boy.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
When the sun rose Mohammed saw
the golden hawk. He ran to catch it,
but it flew away into the sky. One
feather fell from it, and Mohammed
Mohassib picked it up. Then he was
a lucky man and became rich, and went
to Mecca, and to-morrow he will feed
more than three hundred men.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mahmoud&#8217;s ear was caught for the
second time. &#8220;If a man sees the
golden bird will he be a lucky man?&#8221;
he asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, it is Mahmoud who will be
the lucky man,&#8221; said Hassan, with a
laugh. &#8220;To-morrow when Abu el
Haggag has done with his boat
we shall set it to float on the Lake of
Karnak, and Mahmoud shall see it
all golden at night and shall swim out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
to it. But Mahmoud, he never speaks,
so when the sun strikes it the boat of
Abu el Haggag will be for Mahmoud.&#8221;</p>

<p>A short silence followed this profane
speech, for Abu el Haggag is the
great Saint of Luxor, and next day
they held the procession of his sacred
boat.</p>

<p>But Hassan rattled on. &#8220;I make
no feast to-morrow. Everybody else
makes a feast. Nasr says every time
he sees his lady he says, &#8216;I have
bought some sheep and some rice, and
my wife has mixed them together like
so; my wife has made balls of them,
and she will put them in the oven to
bake them. And I will bring you
some.&#8217; Every time he says that. I
would not eat Nasr&#8217;s balls. I will go<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
to Rameses Bar and spend money and
drink whisky.&#8221;</p>

<p>His audacity succeeded in making
itself heard, which was chiefly what he
wanted. And he went on: &#8220;Mahmoud
gets little money from the
Father of the Box. I say to the Father
of the Box when he rides my donkey,
&#8216;Give me more money, this is too little.&#8217;
He says, &#8216;Then I will beat you.&#8217; But
I say to the Mother of the Nose, &#8216;I
am a very poor boy; I am only ten
years old. My father send away my
mother. Who shall give my mother
money?&#8217; Then she says, &#8216;Oh, poor
boy! here is some money.&#8217; I like these
ladies. They are very foolish.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Did you say to the Mother of
the Nose &#8216;My mother is married again<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
to a rich man,&#8217; oh liar?&#8221; asked
Mahmoud.</p>

<p>But at this moment the garden gate
opened and a babel of voices arose:&mdash;&#8220;Take
my donkey; take my donkey;
de best donkey in Luxor.&#8221; &#8220;Here is
Whisky and Soda; no donkey like so.&#8221;
&#8220;Never you believe nobody. Liar
boy. Here is Rameses. Every day
he win a race....&#8221;</p>


<h3>III</h3>

<p>Abu el Haggag&#8217;s boat had come and
passed, poor starveling representative
of the longest pedigree in the world.
Here passed of old the Sacred Bark of
the gods, carrying the precious images<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
and emblems, the king burning incense
before it, the oxen lotus-garlanded for
the sacrifice.</p>

<p>And later this sacred bark lent its
outward form to the Ark of the Most
High God, bearing the simple symbols
of justice and mercy, in the long desert
wanderings and in the Holy Land.</p>

<p>And now the poor, sordid boat on its
little truck passed round; charcoal
burned instead of incense. With the
feeble tradition the Arabs tell that it
was the boat in which Abu the Saint
went to see his friends. This is all
that is left in their minds of that most
ancient idea&mdash;this and the golden
vision of the boat at midnight on
Karnak Lake.</p>

<p>The droning noises of Arab music<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
had died down as Mahmoud ran through
Luxor; a few beggars cleared the
remnants of the feast of Mohammed
Mohassib; while the old man stood
smiling in his doorway over the
memory of his lordly hospitality.
He nodded kindly to Mahmoud
running by.</p>

<p>After he passed the house Mahmoud
paused; he did not dare to go on this
way&mdash;highway though it was&mdash;for he
feared above all the afreet-haunted
bridge that he would have to pass. So
he turned, and running down a narrow
way crossed the empty market-place
and came out on the field road.</p>

<p>The light was dying down and the
sky was cloudy; there was little mist,
but the scent of beanfields hung heavy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
on the air; the corn-blades rustled as
his dress swept them, running. The
barking of the village dogs died down
behind him into silence, so that he
started and nearly fell when a little
cue-owl mewed suddenly from a carob-tree.</p>

<p>Down into the cutting, and as he
mounted again his heart leaped into
his mouth, for a dark figure rose up
above the corn. Then he remembered
that it was only the great lion-headed
statue that sat lonely in the fields, and
he took courage again.</p>

<p>When he came to the road he
paused, debating. Which of the two
ways to the Lake? By the one he
would have to pass the spot where
that fierce golden bird had turned to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
look at him yesterday. By the other
way he must go up the dark sphinx
avenue, a very haunt of afreets. To
go on either way was dreadful; to
stay here not less so; to go back, he
was persuaded now, would be to lose
Fatma.</p>

<p>He turned to the left and entered
the sphinx avenue. A half-grown
moon struggling with the clouds now
and again threw straggling and sharp
shadows of the palm leaves across his
path, but more dreadful was the dry
rustling of the leaves on high when
a cloud passed; before him loomed the
great arch. On each side the sphinxes&mdash;crouched
like strange creatures
with narrow, beak-like noses&mdash;seemed
in the darkness ready to spring.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
And that great black nodding palm-tree,
surely that was an afreet too,
and might catch him. But up the
path bordered with horror he still
ran.</p>

<p>Now he must turn to the right,
before the arch is reached; and but
a short way farther pass those four
images of great old kings mutilated,
but not the less uncanny and fearful
in this dim light. They seemed to
look down on the little figure still
running; but he had passed in safety,
and there lay the lake, black and still
like the pool of ink in which men
saw strange visions.</p>

<p>Mahmoud said his prayer and praise
and lay down to sleep by the
lake....</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span></p>


<h3>IV</h3>

<p>The first time Mahmoud woke the
moon had won the battle, and was
shining on the temple, turning all to
unreal, ethereal building, faintly roseate,
a temple seen in a dream. Mahmoud
looked towards the lake and all was
still; the moon made a white sheet
of water.</p>

<p>The second time Mahmoud woke
the moon was down, but from the
lake came a light&mdash;soft, lambent, golden.
He looked towards it, and oh the glory,
the wonder! a golden boat was riding
on the water.</p>

<p>Mahmoud had often seen under
the hot sun, in some ripple of desert<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
sand, a sudden sheet of water. In the
middle it was clear water, bright,
reflecting the edge of cultivated land.
At the margin it was uncertain; no
eye could tell where it melted into
the shaking haze of heat. So here,
the middle of the boat was clear and
distinct, and on the deck was standing
one single figure; but at the stern and
prow, though he saw figures he saw
them dimly, the outlines of them
melted into the gold reflection of the
water.</p>

<p>The central figure on the deck he
marked from head to foot. He says
he has seen the face outlined on some
temple wall, but he can never find it.
He says, too, it was not unlike the
father of Gorgius the Copt donkey-boy.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
But the father of Gorgius, he added,
was only a fellah-man; this was a
great man, greater than the Khedive
of Egypt, as great as a King of
England.</p>

<p>But of one thing he is certain: not
only had the figure a strange erection
on his head, but he wore a lion&#8217;s
tail behind. Mahmoud&#8217;s eyes were so
riveted to the figure that he could not
tell how the boat moved. He said
something about a sail and something
about oars; but this he knew, that
though it moved on with its golden
reflection over the lake, it stirred no
water in front and no widening ripple
ran out behind.</p>

<p>It was drawing to the shore, and
suddenly, as if it had come within<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
focus, the prow was clear to him,
with a man leaping down to the
land, a coil of golden rope upon his
arm.</p>

<p>What passed next was but the
work of an instant. Without rising
to his feet Mahmoud shot down like
a snake among the stones, and as the
man coiled the rope round a rock
he seized it.</p>

<p>As the lightning flash strikes across
the sky, so the man with this golden
light upon him leaped back; and into
the waters of the lake, into the golden
reflection, sank the boat, without sound
or ripple.</p>

<p>Mahmoud was standing alone by
the black pool in the light of the
stars under the lonely night. But<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
by the light of the stars he saw in
his scarred and bleeding hand the
strands of the golden rope.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Now Mahmoud trails the Mecca
robe through the streets of Luxor,
but they say that Fatma wears the
golden rope.</p>

THE UNSEEN WORLD</h2></div>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> whole world had faded and
darkened to a uniform tint, black and
dingy. The woman who stood there
could hardly say whether this tint
were brown or grey, for there was no
colour to contrast it with, nothing but
her own black dress seen through the
same sordid medium. In front of her,
rather lighter in tint, she could see a
few inches of parapet, on which her
hands were lying, and dimly could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
discern the ground at her feet. If
she leant over the parapet she could
not see the water, but where she
believed it to be, something like the
shadow of a ripple moved across the
dusk.</p>

<p>And as for want of contrast she could
determine no colour, so for want of
distance she could determine no size.
All she saw could be enclosed by four
small walls; all she could not see might
reveal miles of river-bank, streets of
stately houses. It was not the Infinite
but the Indetermined that she looked
upon. Noises had sunk into a hoarse
murmur and swell, dulled as by this
thick, heavy medium. No such monotony
of existence could be conceived;
a world of shadows, an Isle of Voices,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
would be life itself to this. And yet
she believed herself to be standing in
the heart of the greatest city in the
world, but a few paces removed from
streets where men and women were
moving up and down; where her face
was turned across the water stood (she
believed) a great house, a town garden
where wood-pigeons built, and where
she had seen lilies of the valley flower,
saying softly to herself:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">&#8220;Here in dust and dirt, oh here,</div>
<div class="verse">The lilies of His love appear.&#8221;</div>
</div></div>

<p>How was it possible that in so short
a time such a change should fall, such
a swallowing up of life as the centuries
cannot bring to the cities of the south?
Truly she was living by faith in a blank<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
world of existence. A foot or two of
parapet each side of her hands; a foot
or two of gravel each side of her feet&mdash;beyond
that limit nothingness. Yet
by faith she would move in this void.</p>

<p>She turned to the left and walked
along the path which appeared step
by step as she paced, until in front of
her the shadow of a building fell upon
the fog: cornerwise it rose, fading into
mist, and likewise vanished a few feet
above her head.</p>

<p>Yet she believed that this was a great
tower; she believed that the building
stretched away from her, and that at
that moment, gathered inside its halls,
was the Council of the Nation. It is
strange if you think of it, how firmly
she believed in that invisible building,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
in those inaudible deliberations, in the
reality of its connection with the
isolated fragments of parapet and path&mdash;fragments
without visible support,
the only things she could see and the
least of all she believed in.</p>

<p>For as she believed in a present
invisible, so she believed in a future
uncreated; that she should presently
return from where she stood to her
own house, the fragment of visible
world opening before her and above her,
closing behind her as she went. If
she could not find the way, other
figures dawning on her, fog-enwrapped,
would direct her. Strange&mdash;how she
believed in their existence, though she
could neither see nor hear them, how
she trusted in their good faith, though<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
she knew neither who they were nor
whence they would come, in their
greater knowledge, though all men
were more or less astray in the same
fog.</p>

<p>So resting peaceably in this belief
she looked again over the parapet.</p>

<p>A shadow on blank colourlessness in
front; a splash as of water to the ear.
The shadow deepened, defined itself,
and out of nothingness grew a great
black barge; it seemed to float on
water that she could not see. Two
men, one with body bent forward, one
with body swayed back, swung a great
oar at the stern. They were steering
in this indistinguishable world; in this
chaos of a world, threading their way
between dangers undiscerned till ruin<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
was impending. Now the black outline
was opposite to her and now the
barge was shortened, and still the two
figures swayed and bent, swayed and
bent, at their steering. The dark vision
faded into darkness again. Out of
nothing grew that barge, into nothing
it went.</p>

<p>The third thing she saw was this:
just below the parapet where the fog
was least thick, out of nothingness came
a bird, like a little white spirit. It
was smaller than a seagull; its wings,
delicately shaded with brown, showed
a sharper outline, and round them
ran a dark line; the head too was
dark.</p>

<p>A moment it hung below her lightly
poised, white wings uplifted, head<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
down-bent, feet down-dropped towards
the flood below. Then this too
vanished in the mist.</p>

<p>And having seen that she went
away content.</p>

FROM THE BANK OF THE
RIVER</h2></div>


<h3>I</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">In</span> a room in an hotel of the south
some one was lying ill. It was March,
and an airless, parching heat lay outside,
the palms drooped yellow leaves, the
bee-eaters chattering on a carob-bush
dived luxuriantly into corn so green
that they were in no wise distinguished
from it; they turned and fluttered like
butterflies, and from the bronze wing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
feathers a sheen of gold rippled over
their emerald in the sun.</p>

<p>Inside the room was as cool as it
might be; when, from time to time,
the shutters were opened the glory of
gold and green outside flashed into
sight. Outside life was heavy with
heat, luxuriant, substantial; bounded,
limited and weighed down by its very
fullness.</p>

<p>Inside life had dwindled to a thin
thread of consciousness, or rather it
seemed like two strands worn nearly
to breaking lying side by side. The
one, the actual physical consciousness
of a corporal life ebbing, of breath
drawn with difficulty; of physical
sensation not perhaps actually painful,
but almost altogether wearying&mdash;a consciousness<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
close to that mysterious
land of delusions, where the physical
symptoms are set apart from the
personal consciousness and become external
antagonistic forces. It was not
intolerable because it was becoming a
thing more and more external, more
separate from that other spiritual consciousness
with which it was still
lightly entwined.</p>

<p>And that other thread of being, how
shall one describe it? It was not quite
continuous, for now and again the
physical sensation numbed it; now and
then, when times of refreshment came,
the other like a stream rose and
engulfed it.</p>

<p>Compare that old image of the
Rhone and the Saone. The one flows<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
on, blue, clear, transparent; the other
side by side, turbulent, muddy and
swift. The man lying here seemed
to himself to be both, but most of
all the clearer thinner stream. The
turbulence, the force of the other is
daily less and less himself, more and
more an alien power to which he
yet jealously clings in the body of
this death, and will not, cannot part
from it.</p>

<p>And from time to time comes a
new impulse of the stronger torrent&mdash;its
yellowing waters tinge the blue&mdash;it
is fuller, and there is a sense of
well-being; and yet that transparent
river of spiritual being, clear as crystal,
has been sullied, it has disappeared.</p>

<p>Such little trivial things too will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
give him back the life which is his
power and his bondage;&mdash;the cup of
iced coffee, that he looks for and can
drink when other food nauseates, this
makes him feel that he lives again and
yet kills that clearer, sweeter, finer,
life;&mdash;as much, in a sense, as overpowering
bodily discomfort kills it&mdash;more,
perhaps, for the more it overpowers
the more external it is, the
less it is himself.</p>

<p>If only he can keep from fear, for
that kills all. And yet this thread of
consciousness, which I have called
spiritual, is not thinking any thought,
it is seeing visions, and these visions
are not of another world but of the
sweeter, purer things of this world,
transfigured and serene. He is a child<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
again in a Cornish lane, and the grass
is deep and dewy, the banks are high,
crowned with little bushes nearly bare of
leaf, for it is spring; deep in the grass
are primroses, long stalked and growing
by the handful, you can thrust your
hand into the damp grass, rich in little
ferns and unnamed leaves, and pluck
them so; between the primroses there
are violets&mdash;are they purple or grey or
blue?&mdash;and here and there a celandine,
golden yellow. Or he is a boy
sitting on a rock; his feet are bare,
the sea is shallow round him, the
ripples run out, and the sun shining
through them laces the fine sand below
with gold. He tells the nurses that
as soon as he is well he will go to
the sea and dip his feet in it.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>Then he thinks of music that he
knows, and it comes with unutterable
sweetness of cadence like music heard
in dreams.</p>

<p>And this radiance lies not only on
things imagined but on things seen.
The roses brought into the room are
the roses of Dorothea; the scent of
the palm, in blossom outside, fills the
room with an ethereal fragrance; and
oh, those clusters of waxen palm
flowers that his friends bring in and
place in the green jug, surely it
must come from that tree whose very
leaves are for the healing of the
nations!</p>

<p>It is only at night that the horror
comes&mdash;no nameless horror, but the
horror of fighting with the darkness;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
it is hot, and it stifles. The doctors
have been, and he knows their report
is not good though no one has told
him so. The medicine bottles begin
to change; there is one like a
knight&#8217;s head near the candle, he
knows it is only a cork in it, but it
is very like the armoured head of a
knight; and the darkness comes near,
it oppresses all, laying a heavy hand
on the world: it is too near, too
heavy, all round us and weighing on
us above.</p>

<p>He sleeps, to shout at the people
in the room&mdash;he asks the nurse to
expel the Arab who is beside the bed.
He knows they are not there at all,
but he does not want to sleep, for he
will wake in that horrible strangle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
of breath. It is so long, if only there
were any light at all! Weary, interminable
length, and some lines of a
poem run in his mind:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">&#8220;An hour or two more and God is so kind</div>
<div class="verse">The day will be blue in the window blind.&#8221;</div>
<div class="verse"><hr class="tb" /></div>
<div class="verse">&#8220;Thank the kind God the carts come in.&#8221;</div>
</div></div>

<p>They come in so early in London.&mdash;Only
an hour or two is quiet in the
night, and you would know that the
world is alive again, one would not
have to keep the darkness long at bay;
but here the night is day-long. Brandy&mdash;what
is the good? The smell is nauseating;
but it is at his lips, and he
drinks. Has he slept? but it is black
and still and dark, the dogs howl and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
scuffle past the window. Hours more
to come, hours of the blackness. One
of these people who is about the room
sits down by the bed. She is not
terrifying. She is only an old lady
with grey hair, but she expects something.
She must be told to go away;
they will not tell her, and he is angry
with urging. But of course she was
not really there, it was only a dream;
so he must have slept again, and the
minutes must have passed.</p>

<p>There is a hint of grey in the sky,
the whisper of a breeze in the palm
leaves&mdash;dawn is coming. Now there
is one hour of horror to go through,
for the windows must be shut; he
cannot breathe&mdash;he cannot live like
this for an hour. The door into the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
passage may be opened, and the nurse&#8217;s
step falls cold and echoing on the stone
outside; no one else is moving, it is all
grey and cold; he knows how that
empty passage must look. This is
better, for the blackness is going.</p>

<p>He sees the palm-trees outside above
the muslin blinds; all the world is still
and dead, its light gone out, but it can
be rekindled. From the other window
nothing can be seen but colourless sky,
but the sky itself begins to kindle into
life.</p>

<p>Suddenly something falls across the
muslin blind; a bar, and a dot of sunlight,
of that molten gold of Egyptian
sunshine before the day has dried it
into dust of gold. Oh the extraordinary
beauty of that gold! Has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
sunshine been always in the world
before, and yet we never knew it was
like that? The darkness has passed,
the light shines, the rapture and the
beauty of the light spreads and
broadens; the sky is awake, the garden
is alive, the night is gone&mdash;and now
the window towards the south is
thrown open, and very faint and fair,
a delicate violet light lies on the hills
beyond the river. The air is blown in
sweet, fragrant, unspeakably pure; and
that carob-tree on which the birds sat
yesterday is green and fresh, and below
is the blue-green of the corn into
which they dropped.</p>

<p>An Arab is riding on his camel along
the dyke, they are outlined against that
purple hill. So people still live and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
move outside; they can move then, they
can go where they wish. But he sees
the sun, and the breath of heaven
comes in, and the night is passed. He
is tired with this warring against the
night, but the light has come and the
clearer, brighter river is flowing again.
This is day.</p>

<p>What is this land where the spirit
has been living? Is it the land of
Beulah or the Valley of the Shadow?
Which is most real? He knows which
is most substantial, but why is it most
real? The instrument is more substantial
than the melody and infinitely
less real. Yet when the veil grows
thin which hides the glory of the
vision, agonizing we entreat that it
may not be removed and show the
glory of the face.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Many</span> have written of the journey
down to the dark river; few have
told of the road backward from the
river&#8217;s brink; a road of sudden ecstasies
and sordid pitfalls.</p>

<p>For the radiance lay over the earth
when he turned his face to it again.
Nothing was ever sweeter than the
sight of palm leaves against the blue
upon the banks of the Nile. As
the shores streamed past, with the rosy
hills and yellow lights above them,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
winged feluccas furling sail, or sweeping
like birds across the blue, with
the roaring of the swiftness of their
motion, he could lie and look&mdash;weary
with rapture&mdash;watching the figures
sprung from the old Palestinian story&mdash;a
rugged Peter wrapping his fisher&#8217;s
cloak about him, or urging his fellows
&#8220;I go a-fishing.&#8221; But slowly, imperceptibly,
the walls of the world
closed in again; the sun beat pitilessly
down; the heavens were brass, the
earth iron. Now and again they
would open out at the sight of the
sapphire sparkle of the Mediterranean,
or the deep, green growth under
blossoming orchards of France. The
wind became the life-giving breath of
the spirit, and the soul would &#8220;beat&#8221;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
against &#8220;mortal bars,&#8221; seeing infinite
power, infinite possibility, lying but
just beyond the frail partition; a
touch, and he might glide from the
mountain side down over the trees
that slept in the noonday of the valley;
a hand on the eyes, and they would
see to the truth that lies beneath form
and colour of earthly things; a finger
on the ear, and he would hear the
very meaning of the wind and of
the trickle of the stream&mdash;the gift
of tongues would be an imaginably
natural incident.</p>

<p>Yet next day, at some trifling ailment,
death and its terrors compass him
about, and the man shakes as with
ague under the fear of it and shame
of cowardice. Or he wakes every<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
morning seemingly refreshed, only to
fall by midday into a gulf of blackness
and mistrust, sordid, not tragic, not
dignified; and he sits tongue-tied,
seeing a sneer in every smile, marvelling
that men do not see the loathsomeness
and terror that lie around them, but
walk unconcerned among the dangers
that encompass. Then again life
returns in full flood, and the fears and
the terrors are as the fabric of a dream.</p>

<p>A long, strange way, full of inexplicable
joys and sorrows, hopes and
fears&mdash;a far longer path to travel in
the spirit than that by which he
came &#8220;out of the iron furnace, even
out of Egypt,&#8221; to the cool airs and
sweet quiet of an old English country
house in wooded downs touched by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
the freshness of the sea. There in
the south, after the first bound towards
health, life had stood still; the parched,
sapless land could yield dry, clear air,
sharp bright sunlight, but no refreshment
of health and of spirit,
nothing that could be compared to
the misty mornings, and soft dewy
evenings of a mild English spring.
There the spring brings no refreshment;
March reaps her harvest
and the palm leaves hang dry and
yellowish: here all life was stirring
after the winter sleep, and earth was
striving in her own finite way to
make all things new. It was long
since he had seen an English spring,
and the eye could not be satisfied
with gazing.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>He first noticed it when, looking
on the wintry copses, he saw that a
thin ripple of life had run over the
ground; among brown stalks and
withered leaves so slight a flush of
green that you could hardly say, &#8220;It is
here&#8221; or &#8220;It is there,&#8221; nor surely know
the change was worked to the outer
eye or noted by the reanimate perception.
Then the fine veil of skeleton
branches against the sky, through,
under, beyond which he could see
the blue downs of the coast, thickened,
and they warmed in colour; till the
brown of the elm became purple,
and the brown of the beeches red,
and the willow golden: then the elm
burst into its little purple rosettes but
the others stayed. And now crept<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
out those little silvery creatures which
the children call palms; like little
downy animals, so sweet, so comfortable
that the child must half believe they
are alive. Early in April the clumps
of crocus in the turf, purple and yellow,
were dying, but the daffodils were
beginning to take their place, strewing
the rough grass with flowers of milky
gold. A week later the snake-heads
were drawing themselves out of the
turf, with head curved downwards
like a swan preening its breast;
primroses were waking in the lanes,
the larch was hanging &#8220;rosy
plumelets,&#8221; the silver leaf buds of
the apple were out, and the flower
of the peach.</p>

<p>This was cuckoo day, and punctual<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
to the moment they hooted in the
wood below; they had come in good
time for the later nests, for the wagtails
had taken their last year&#8217;s tenement
again in the ivied wall, and the
untidy sparrows were littering lawn
and garden.</p>

<p>Again a week, and the cherry buds
showed fawn coloured; two days they
stayed so, then a little tree burst into
flower. Two days more, and the
orchard looked as if a snow shower
had lightly fallen. At last one windy
day white blossoms came drifting down
among the scarlet tulips, and after
this a rose-tinge passed over the trees,
like a faint sunset on the snow, and
then the glory was gone. But the
expanding spirit could not bewail the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
glory gone, for warmer weather came
with sun like summer, so that the
plum-tree on the wall burst into flower
one morning while one sat under it;
a purple iris appeared, the blackthorn
whitened, and in the garden beds the
peonies and lilies shot up, anemones
dozed half their radiant life away in
royal groups, purple and scarlet. The
remembrance of trembling and helplessness
fell from the man, and he
laughed to see the peacock&#8217;s grave and
measured dance and the fierce cock
chaffinch wooing in his bright spring
coat.</p>

<p>So the spring returned, unfolding
infinite new delights, sometimes hurrying,
sometimes delaying; the copses
clothed themselves in foliage as light<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
as a birch grove, with all fine gradations
of colour from the grey palms grown
old, to the golden oaks beginning,
and all life and all activity responded.
Though storms and chill might check
the budding, the renewal of the spring
moved in man and nature, as man and
nature shook off the memory of death
and winter, warmed and revivified in
the waxing power of the sun.</p>

<p>And the world found voice for its joy,
and it was joy to lie awake in the hour
before dawn, while the last fine song of
the nightingale still lingered in the
memory, and hear the untutored song
echo from bush to bush; when the
thrush and the blackbird waked, and
the starling chattered, and the cock
chimed in with the lusty bar of music<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
of his bugle call, and all in chorus
welcomed the day, and ceased.</p>

<p>And one morning, as the man leaned
out of his window to drink the sweet
air of growing things, he saw suddenly,
that the desire of spring was satiate.
The trees had burst their buds and
made a glory of golden leaves. Life
no longer pulsed, stayed, hurried on,
but flowed in the full tide of summer.
Summer would burst into glories of
beauty and odour on this side and on
that, but the fresh impulse of spring
was over. And the man leaned out
and revelled in it. The rough bank
had covered its scars with lush green
grass; and leaves, stems, and branches
were hidden. He revelled in the
odorous, sun-warmed air, in the pleasant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
kindly earth with its beauties, in the
sight and sound of the happy living
things, and he looked away towards
the hills, but they were hidden. Then
all at once he saw the blindness of
content, and he cried out &#8220;Oh my soul,
where are the heavenly horizons and
the distant misty hills?&#8221;</p>

<p>For while he gazed, the veil had
fallen; at first translucent, radiant;
threads fine as gossamer shining with
light, so that they seemed but to
illuminate the distance. Then the
veil was inwrought with flowers and as
each new beauty came, he said &#8220;This
is God&#8217;s work, and I can see Him in
this; all this symbolizes the light of
His countenance, and I see Him in His
world.&#8221; And of each human interest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
and activity he said, &#8220;This is God&#8217;s
work, for it is the work of His
children.&#8221; So it fell fold on fold,
thickening imperceptibly, full of sweet
odours as it fell, and the voices of
birds; and he did not know that the
focus of his view was contracting, and
that he was beginning to look not
through the veil but at it. And he
did not see that there was another hand
at work and other threads in the web,
grosser, more earthly, and darker yet;
and that as it was woven, warp and
woof, other hands threw the shuttle.</p>

<p>So it fell, closing out the heavenly
vision, hiding too the clouds and darkness
round God&#8217;s seat; and he found
himself gazing on the veil which men
call this world. Then with a great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
struggle he cried, &#8220;In the time of our
wealth, good Lord deliver us.&#8221;</p>


<h3>III</h3>

<p>The year came round again, and this
man had found no contentment for mind
or heart. He was such a one as had
always believed in the unity of God
and nature, had held the visible
universe to be the robe of His glory
and the material to be like clothing
which partly hides and partly reveals
the form.</p>

<p>He was a man whom God had chastened
a little in the flesh, so that He
might know the Hand that touched
him, yet had given him no loathsome<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
evil thing to be with him, so that he
must hate even the body that served
him. God had given him amply of the
good things of life and sufficiently of
its sorrows to make him know the first
were good. He had early looked into
the empty tomb and seen that since
even the body can in time elude it, it
would be beyond reason and belief to
dream that the soul can be prisoned by
it. For the soul is not even prisoned
by the body, seeing that it can walk
among the stars, thread the secret places
of the earth, or dive into the seas, while
the eyes of the body stare upon a book;
or it can fight battles and go through
many strange adventures and visit distant
lands while the eyes are closed and the
body is laid upon the bed. Therefore<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
this man had long believed in his soul,
though he had not taught his life and
his fancies that though the material
sometimes appears to be greater and
stronger and older than the spiritual,
yet that this is merely as the flower
seems to one who looks not below the
ground to be more vital than the root.
So though he believed this, the man
could not understand what the truth of
the world might be. For he saw that
although one may rejoice in its beauties
and delight even in wholly innocent
things, believing truly that they come
from God, yet many men thus go
astray. And when he listened to the
voices of the dearest of God&#8217;s servants
he became all the more perplexed.
For one cried &#8220;All things are yours,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
things present as well as things to come&#8221;;
but another said &#8220;Love not the world.&#8221;
Again he heard one say &#8220;It is good to
be here; let us build three tabernacles&#8221;;
and saw him that said it straightway
led into the dust and turmoil of the
incredulous crowd. And the sweetest
voice said now &#8220;Deny yourself,&#8221; and
now &#8220;Consider the lilies, consider the
birds.&#8221;</p>

<p>This man was a man who always loved
the water. It made a great calm in his
mind to see the sea spread calm before
his feet; the storm of the sea filled him
with life, and to die in the sea would,
he thought, be like a child sinking to
sleep in its mother&#8217;s arms. Clear,
translucent water drew him with a
great longing, and he dreamt often<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
that he should bathe, but as his
feet touched the water it ebbed
away.</p>

<p>Now near his home there spread,
embowered in trees, a great lake; on
one side ran a road neglected and
seldom used, from this the lake ran up
curving out of sight. Half-way up
towards the curve there stood a great
oak, and beneath this he often bathed.
So being in this perplexity he went out
one summer morning, passed through
the sleeping village and by the church,
and went down to the lake.</p>

<p>And in the turn of the year again
the woods were lightly foliaged, and
the branches shone golden between the
leaves; the ground beneath the oak
was carpeted with hyacinths and primroses,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
here and there a late anemone
starred it.</p>

<p>Here he undressed and plunged from
a little height into a pool. His hands
parted the water, which rushed up him
as he plunged; then he gave himself
up to the element and it lifted him to the
surface. Again he warred with it, yet
moved by means of it, with steady stroke
parting it, and again he turned over and
yielded himself up to it, and the least
movement was enough to keep him
floating on the surface, and he rejoiced
in the coolness and the purity. So
when he had finished he returned and
clothed himself, and moved on through
the edge of the wood, looking at the
water, wondering at a transparency that
was so deep and the strength of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
fleeting thing, till he came to where a
little wooden bridge spanned the overflow
from the lake; and upon the
bridge a boy of about eight years old
was sitting.</p>

<p>He was not dressed like a village
child; his cap lay beside him with a
little spray of reddening oak stuck
into it, and he was staring at the
water.</p>

<p>&#8220;Who are you, my son?&#8221; said the
man as he passed.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m a king,&#8221; the child replied;
&#8220;but I&#8217;m an outlaw just now, you
see,&#8221; he went on, laying his hand
on his cap. &#8220;I can&#8217;t get into my
kingdom.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Where is your kingdom?&#8221; asked
the man.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>&#8220;Come down here and you&#8217;ll see,&#8221;
he said.</p>

<p>The man sat down beside him on the
plank.</p>

<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t see much,&#8221; he said, &#8220;the
water is dazzling.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, those are the sun&#8217;s messengers,&#8221;
said the boy; &#8220;the sun sends messengers
millions and millions of miles to the
lake and they telegraph back to him.
But you must look in another place.&#8221;</p>

<p>The man slipped into the humour of
the child.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now I see your kingdom,&#8221; he
said; &#8220;it has greenish forests waving,
strange transparent creatures move
silently about.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, that&#8217;s not my kingdom,&#8221; the
child answered, &#8220;why, I can get in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
there; but it is not like what you think.
Those are slippery fishes and the
bottom is all slimy. You must fix
your eyes tight and not let them slip to
see my kingdom.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Now I see it,&#8221; said the other; &#8220;it
has beautiful blue sky, trees stretch
twigs into it which glisten like gold&mdash;one
spreads leaves like jewelled glass
with the sun shining through; one
stretches budding twigs made of ruby;
it is far, far below the shine and the
fishes; and yet when I look it is quite
close to us.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, that&#8217;s my kingdom!&#8221; cried the
child.</p>

<p>&#8220;But isn&#8217;t it just like that behind
us?&#8221; said the man, to test him.</p>

<p>The boy looked round. &#8220;No, that&#8217;s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
out-of-doors,&#8221; he said. &#8220;My kingdom
is much more happy and safe, and the
sky is more shining and the leaves
glitter.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But it&#8217;s the sun&#8217;s kingdom down
there even where the shine is,&#8221; said the
man.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I know it&#8217;s his,&#8221; said the boy;
&#8220;if he didn&#8217;t send messengers down
there it would be all inky black and
dreadful; but they won&#8217;t let his messengers
get through, only a few of
them, a little yellowish, greenish light.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Is out-of-doors his kingdom too?&#8221;
then said the man.</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course it&#8217;s his,&#8221; said the child;
&#8220;if he wasn&#8217;t there it would be dark,
and the wind would sob and the trees
shake their branches.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>&#8220;And what about your kingdom?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, he makes that for me,&#8221; said
the child, &#8220;to be all my own.&#8221;</p>

<p>The man sat a moment looking at
the water and was silent; a starling
chattered on the boughs above; far
away came the cry of the cuckoo; at
the right hand of them there was a little
rustle as a snake slipped over dead leaves
and through the new living shoots of
spring, and paused.</p>

<p>The man turned to the child.</p>

<p>&#8220;But is it real?&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s just as real as the sun and the
water and out-of-doors,&#8221; said the boy
steadily.</p>

<p>&#8220;But you said some day you would
get in,&#8221; answered the man, tempting
him.</p>




<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>The boy turned and looked at him,
and his eyes were like a great stream
with the sun shining through. &#8220;And
that&#8217;s just as real as me,&#8221; he
said.</p>

<p>The man snapped the twig he held
in his hand, the snake silently slipped
through the brake and was gone, and
the man stood up, yet paused a moment
looking down at the shining world,
then he got up.</p>

<p>&#8220;Goodbye,&#8221; he said, &#8220;I must go
and look for my kingdom. I had one
once but I lost it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Shall you be able to get in?&#8221; asked
the boy.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not just yet, perhaps,&#8221; he said,
&#8220;but I can look at it till I find the way
in.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>So he went back through the wood,
remembering that it was written,
&#8220;Out of the mouth of babes thou hast
perfected praise.&#8221;</p>

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without

Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,

to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means

Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
